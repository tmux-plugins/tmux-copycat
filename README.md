# Tmux copycat

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tmux-plugins/tmux-copycat.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tmux-plugins/tmux-copycat)

**NOTE: [tmux 3.1 adds support for native regex searches](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tmux/tmux/3.1/CHANGES).
This is great news because it means a big part of 'tmux-copycat' is now
available natively! Use this plugin only if you need its other features.**

This plugin enables:

- regex searches (native support added in tmux 3.1)
- search result highlighting
- predefined searches`

Predefined searches are plugin killer feature. It speeds the workflow and
reduces mouse usage with Tmux.

It works even better when paired with
[tmux yank](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-yank). Tested and working on
Linux, OSX and Cygwin.

### Screencast

[![screencast screenshot](/video/screencast_img.png)](https://vimeo.com/101867689)

#### Search

- `prefix + /` - regex search (strings work too)

Example search entries:

- `foo` - searches for string `foo`
- `[0-9]+` - regex search for numbers

Grep is used for searching.<br/>
Searches are case insensitive.<br/>

#### Predefined searches

- `prefix + ctrl-f` - simple *f*ile search
- `prefix + ctrl-g` - jumping over *g*it status files (best used after `git status` command)
- `prefix + alt-h` - jumping over SHA-1/SHA-256 hashes (best used after `git log` command)
- `prefix + ctrl-u` - *u*rl search (http, ftp and git urls)
- `prefix + ctrl-d` - number search (mnemonic d, as digit)
- `prefix + alt-i` - *i*p address search

These start "copycat mode" and jump to first match.

You can define [your own custom searches](/docs/defining_new_stored_searches.md) as well. Here's an example:

```shell
set -g @copycat_search_C-l '[a-zA-Z0-9_./-]+$'
```

#### "Copycat mode" bindings

These are enabled when you search with copycat:

- `n` - jumps to the next match
- `N` - jumps to the previous match

To copy a highlighted match:

- `Enter` - if you're using Tmux `vi` mode
- `ctrl-w` or `alt-w` - if you're using Tmux `emacs` mode

Copying a highlighted match will take you "out" of copycat mode. Paste with
`prefix + ]` (this is Tmux default paste).

Copying highlighted matches can be enhanced with
[tmux yank](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-yank).

### Installation with [Tmux Plugin Manager](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm) (recommended)

Add plugin to the list of TPM plugins in `.tmux.conf`:

    set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-copycat'

Hit `prefix + I` to fetch the plugin and source it. You should now be able to
use the plugin.

Optional (but recommended) install `gawk` via your package manager of choice
for better UTF-8 character support.

### Manual Installation

Clone the repo:

    $ git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-copycat ~/clone/path

Add this line to the bottom of `.tmux.conf`:

    run-shell ~/clone/path/copycat.tmux

Reload TMUX environment with: `$ tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf`. You should now
be able to use the plugin.

Optional (but recommended) install `gawk` via your package manager of choice
for better UTF-8 character support.

### Installation for Tmux 2.3 and earlier

Due to the changes in tmux, the latest version of this plugin doesn't support
tmux 2.3 and earlier. It is recommended you upgrade to tmux version 2.4 or
later. If you must continue using older version, please follow
[these steps for installation](docs/installation_for_tmux_2.3.md).

### Limitations

This plugin has some known limitations. Please read about it
[here](docs/limitations.md).

### Docs

- Most of the behavior of tmux-copycat can be customized via tmux options.
  [Check out the full options list](docs/customizations.md).
- To speed up the workflow you can define new bindings in `.tmux.conf` for
  searches you use often, more info [here](docs/defining_new_stored_searches.md)

### Other goodies

`tmux-copycat` works great with:

- [tmux-yank](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-yank) - enables copying
  highlighted text to system clipboard
- [tmux-open](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-open) - a plugin for quickly
  opening a highlighted file or a url
- [tmux-continuum](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-continuum) - automatic
  restoring and continuous saving of tmux env

### Test suite

This plugin has a pretty extensive integration test suite that runs on
[travis](https://travis-ci.org/tmux-plugins/tmux-copycat).

When run locally, it depends on `vagrant`. Run it with:

    # within project top directory
    $ ./run-tests
